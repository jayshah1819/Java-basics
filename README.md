# Java-basics

ðŸš§ **Currently Working On It!**  


This repository contains Java programs and concepts that I revised and practiced during my learning journey. The code covers foundational and advanced Java topics, including object-oriented programming, exception handling, multithreading, packages, and wrapper classes.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### 1. **Classes, Objects, and Methods**
- Defined custom classes like `Student`, `Calculator`, and `AdvanceCalculator`.
- Demonstrated **constructor overloading** and usage of `this` keyword.
- Implemented **method overloading** and **method overriding**.
- Showcased class-based design and object instantiation.

### 2. **Exception Handling**
- Used `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions like `ArithmeticException` and `NullPointerException`.
- Demonstrated nested `try-catch` inside methods like `divide()`.
- Created custom error flow for array index issues.

### 3. **Packages**
- Organized code using custom packages like `ExceptionHandling`, `OOPsConcepts`, `PackagesExample`, `WrapperClassExamp`, and `StackTrace`.
- Showed how to structure modular Java projects using packages.

### 4. **Garbage Collection & Null References**
- Demonstrated runtime exceptions using `null` object access to simulate memory management issues.
- Used null assignment and access to explain how Java handles references and garbage collection triggers.

### 5. **Wrapper Classes**
- Explored `Integer` class and its methods.
- Highlighted the difference between primitive types (`int`) and their wrapper classes (`Integer`).
- Practiced using wrapper methods like `hashCode()`.

### 6. **Multithreading & Thread Lifecycle**
- Created a `World` class extending `Thread` to demonstrate parallel execution.
- Explained thread lifecycle from creation to termination using `start()` and `run()` methods.

### 7. **Stack Trace Debugging**
- Created multiple method levels (`level1`, `level2`, `level3`) to simulate stack traces during runtime errors.
- Captured and printed exceptions to understand error propagation and debugging techniques.

This repository serves as both a personal learning log and a reference for others who are learning Java. I aim to make the examples simple, relevant, and easy to follow.
